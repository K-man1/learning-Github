# Learing Git and GitHub for beginners

To push code to GitHub from your local computer, you will need to have Git installed on your computer. Once you have Git installed, you can follow these steps

## Here are the steps you must follow:
1. Open a terminal or command prompt window and navigate to the directory where your code is located.
2. Make sure that you are on the branch that you want to push to GitHub.
3. Run the following command:
git push origin <branch name>
4. Replace <branch name> with the name of the branch that you want to push.
For example, if you want to push the main branch to GitHub, you would run the following command:
git push origin main
Once you have pushed your code to GitHub, it will be visible to other collaborators who have access to the repository.

## Here are some additional tips for pushing code to GitHub:
1. Make sure that you have committed all of your changes before you push.
2. If you are pushing to a public repository, you may want to create a private branch to work on your changes before you push them to the main branch.
3. You can also use a Git client like GitHub Desktop to push your code to GitHub.
4. I hope this helps!
